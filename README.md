#### BackStory
We all know our beloved old Snake game. Moreover, a lot of Gen Z-ers that spend a lot of time on TikTok know about the Dabloon trend: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFnykqLu/
So what better way to revive the Snake Game for the younger henerations, than by making our dear snake a dabloon collector.

#### Game description
The player controls a creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up dabloons, trying to avoid hitting itself. 

#### Instruction on how to play
You need to collect the dabloons (blinking dots). Each blinkind dot represents one dabloon. You can move on the board with the joystick. 
If the button is pressed while playing, the game ends and a quit message is shown. If pressed one more time, the stats of the player are shown.
You can change the value of the time the dabloons are showing on the map and the obstacles difficulty.
