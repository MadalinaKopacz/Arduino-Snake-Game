#### BackStory
We all know our beloved old Snake game. Moreover, a lot of Gen Z-ers that spend a lot of time on TikTok know about the Dabloon trend:

- https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFnykqLu/

So what better way to revive the Snake Game for the younger generations, than by making our dear snake a dabloon collector.

#### Game description
The player controls a creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up dabloons (blinking dots), trying to avoid hitting itself.  The goal is collecting as many dabloons as possible. During the game, the speed increases fast and the snake length grows.

#### Instruction on how to play
You need to collect the dabloons (blinking dots). Each blinking dot represents one dabloon. You can move on the board with the joystick. 
If the button is pressed while playing, the game ends. Also, if you love (you hit yourself) or you win (collect a lot of dabloons), the game ends and a message is shown. If pressed one more time, the stats of the player are shown.
You can change the speed increase factor and the starting level.
